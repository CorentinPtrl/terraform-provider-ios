## Schema

### Required

- `mask` (String) The subnet mask for the static route, e.g., '255.255.255.0'. This is required to specify the network size.
- `next_hop` (String) The next-hop IP address for the static route, e.g., '192.168.20.1'. This is the IP address of the next router to which packets should be forwarded.
- `prefix` (String) The destination network prefix for the static route, e.g., '192.168.21.0', without the subnet mask.
